### 2048 clone for practice

## Things I might add/alter soon

1. Make the movements more fluid. Right now they're ridged and don't actually slide, more like disappear and reappear.
2. Change the colors around a bit.
3. As of now, if no movement can be made, you can use the arrow to give the illusion of movement and get a tile to appear anyway.
4. Add a leaderboard, for when I put this on my site. Probably also integrate with an SQLite DB and display the leaderboard that way.
